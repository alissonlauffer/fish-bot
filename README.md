# fish-bot

A simple bot written in fish using curl and jq.

I did this in about 2 hours, just for fun and research.

It only answers `/start` and `hi` in private chats.

## Running

Make sure you install `curl` and `jq` and then run:

```shell
bot_token='1234567890:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890' ./bot.fish
```
